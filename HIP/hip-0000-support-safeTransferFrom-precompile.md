## Abstract

This proposal introduces support for the ERC-721 `safeTransferFrom` function across both the **Hedera Token Service (HTS) Precompiled Contract and the HTS Facade Contract**. The goal is to improve EVM equivalence and developer experience by allowing DApps, wallets, and smart contracts to use standard NFT transfer semantics on Hedera with minimal friction.

The feature will align with the ERC-721 standard, performing the `onERC721Received` callback check for contract recipients and supporting Hedera-specific automatic token association.

## Motivation

Developers expect the standard ERC-721 `safeTransferFrom` function to work on any EVM chain. Its absence in the Hedera ecosystem forces developers to write chain-specific code and prevents direct deployment of existing, audited Ethereum contracts.

While the current HTS precompile supports ERC-20 and ERC-721 interfaces through `transferFrom`, the lack of `safeTransferFrom` limits compatibility with standard tooling such as OpenZeppelin-based contracts, NFT marketplaces, and multi-chain wallets.

Adding support for `safeTransferFrom` via both the precompile `(0x167)` and the facade contract ensures that developers can seamlessly interact with HTS NFTs using standard ERC interfaces, whether by calling the precompile directly or by using a token’s EVM address.

## Rationale

This proposal extends the HTS precompile to handle `safeTransferFrom` calls for NFTs, while also exposing the same functionality through the HTS facade contract, ensuring both low-level and user-facing EVM parity.

### Dual Support Design

1. **Precompile Support(0x167)**:

- Direct smart contract calls to the HTS precompile will now recognize the two standard `safeTransferFrom` function selectors.
- The precompile performs ownership and approval checks, auto-association (if possible), and the `onERC721Received` callback for contract recipients.

2. **Facade Contract Support**:

- As with `transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom` will also be callable through a token’s EVM address.
- This allows developers using the standard ERC-721 interface (`IERC721`) to interact directly with HTS tokens without having to reference the precompile address.

This dual implementation ensures compatibility with both tooling-based interaction (via facade) and direct system-level calls (via precompile).

## User Stories

- **As an NFT marketplace developer**, I want to deploy my existing, audited Ethereum contract on Hedera with minimal changes. By supporting the standard `safeTransferFrom` function, I can ensure compatibility with wallets and tools while preventing assets from being locked in contracts that can’t handle them.
- **As a gamer using a Web3 application**, I want to receive an in-game NFT reward from the game’s smart contract. The transfer should not fail just because my wallet wasn’t pre-configured for that specific NFT. The system should handle the association for me automatically.
- **As an EVM developer**, I want to use a standard, safe function to transfer HTS-backed NFTs without needing to write custom logic to handle Hedera's specific token association requirements.

## Specification

### Function Signatures and Selectors

The following ERC-721 standard function selectors will be recognized by both the HTS precompile (`0x167`) and the HTS facade contract:

| hash | signature | Notes |
| 0x42842e0e | safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256) | Standard ERC-721 safe transfer |
| 0xb88d4fde | safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes) | Standard ERC-721 safe transfer with data payload |

### Execution Flow

The execution flow for a `safeTransferFrom` call will be as follows:

1. **Authorization Check**
   Verify that `msg.sender` is either the owner or an approved operator for the NFT.
   If not, revert with a standard error.
2. **Association Check and Auto-Association**

- If the recipient account is not associated with the token:
  a. Check if the recipient has available automatic association slots.
  b. If slots exist, perform an automatic association on behalf of the sender.
  c. If not possible, revert the transaction.

3. **Contract Receiver Check**

- If the recipient is a smart contract, invoke `onERC721Received(msg.sender, from, tokenId, data)`.
- If the call reverts or does not return `0x150b7a02`, the entire transaction MUST revert.

4. **Token Transfer**

- Perform a standard `CryptoTransfer` of the NFT from `from` to `to`.
- Ensure the operation is atomic — if any step fails, all effects (including auto-association) are rolled back.

## Backwards Compatibility

This change adds new functionality but does not modify existing behavior.
Existing `transferFrom` and precompile functions continue to behave as before.

Contracts and clients that already interact with HTS tokens using ERC-721 interfaces will benefit from full `safeTransferFrom` support without modification.

## Security Implications

1. **Re-entrancy Risk**: The external `onERC721Received` call must follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to prevent re-entrancy.
2. **Atomicity**: The entire flow must be atomic. If any step fails (e.g., the `onERC721Received` check reverts), the entire operation must roll back to its original state. This includes rolling back any new token association that was created as part of the transaction.
3. **Gas Costs**:
   - Auto-association increases gas consumption.
   - Gas estimation logic in SDKs should reflect the additional cost for automatic association and contract callback checks.

## How to Teach This

- Update the official Hedera documentation to reflect the new capabilities of `safeTransferFrom`.
- Provide examples in SDKs and tutorials showing how a contract can now use the standard `safeTransferFrom` function on an HTS-backed NFT and how it handles association automatically.
- Educate developers that while association is handled automatically where possible, it can still be a reason for transaction failure if the recipient account is not configured to allow it.

## Open Issues

- The precise gas cost for the `safeTransferFrom` function, particularly when it triggers an auto-association, needs to be finalized.
- Should the precompile emit an event if it performs an auto-association during transfer (for better visibility)?
