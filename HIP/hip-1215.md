## Abstract
We generalize HIP-756 ("Contract Scheduled Token Create") by enabling smart contracts to
schedule any contract call via Hedera Schedule Service (HSS). The main design concern is
throttling; that is, what happens when a contract call is scheduled at an expiry second 
that is already full of scheduled work. We support cheap retry logic inside the EVM by
adding a view system contract `hasScheduleCapacity(uint256 expiry, uint256 gasLimit)`
with the approximate gas cost of a cold `SLOAD`. This lets the contract find an
acceptable second (if one exists) with an affordable gas budget.

## Motivation
HIP-755 ("Schedule Service System Contract") extended the ability to schedule transactions
to the Hedera Smart Contract Service. While this is very useful for smart contract calls by
externally owned accounts (EOAs), it requires off-chain coordination, and it does not extend
to smart contracts calling other smart contracts as the origin of the transaction. 
Furthermore, HIP-755 does not fully support regularly scheduled transactions, as the 
off-chain signatures and message submission must be repeated for each transaction.

Extending HIP-756 to call contracts in the future would enable recursive execution and
rescheduling of contract calls, resulting in a "set it and forget it" system by which
contract calls can be made at regularly scheduled intervals as long as the transaction
payer has enough HBAR to cover the scheduling and gas and fees.

## Rationale
This HIP provides the possibility to have fully on-chain "cron jobs" that regularly
call smart contracts, replacing various off-chain mechanisms users have relied on til now.

## User stories

1. **Rebalancing DeFi positions** - A vault contract schedules its own future rebalances.
2. **Vesting claims** - A token vesting contract automatically schedules cliff unlocks.
3. **DAO automation** - Governance logic schedules periodic housekeeping calls (e.g., 
interest reallocation) without relying on bots.

## Specification

### HSS System Contract
The `IHederaScheduleService.sol` interface must be updated to support everything
needed to schedule an arbitrary call from within the EVM, including the `to` address,
the call data to use, the gas limit for the future call, and the value to send with
that call.

An important option is to let the scheduling contract specify a payer address that
may be different from its own. In this case the scheduled call can only execute 
after receiving enough valid signatures to activate the payer's key. The difference
between `scheduleCallWithPayer()` and `executeCallOnPayerSignature()` is that the
former still waits until the consensus second is not before `expirySecond` to execute, while
the latter executes as soon as the payer signs (unless consensus time is already 
past the `expirySecond`, of course).

```

```

None of these calls ever revert. If `scheduleCall()` variants fail, they return with
a zero `address` and a `int64` failure code whose value is the ordinal of a human-meaningful
code in the standard HAPI [`ResponseCodeEnum`](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-consensus-node/blob/main/hapi/hedera-protobuf-java-api/src/main/proto/services/response_code.proto#L24).
For example, if the requested second is saturated, these calls would return with no created
schedule and an `int64` that is the protobuf ordinal of enum value `"SCHEDULE_EXPIRY_IS_BUSY"`.

If the `scheduleCall()` variants succeed, they return the address of the newly created
scheduled transaction and `22` as the status code of `SUCCESS`. A contract may attempt to
delete an already scheduled transaction with the `deleteSchedule(address)`, receiving `22`
iff the delete succeeds. A contract or EOA may also attempt to delete a scheduled transaction
at address `0x00...abcd` by calling a "redirect" `deleteSchedule()` function at that address.

```

The `hasScheduleCapacity()` returns `true` iff the given second still has capacity to
schedule a contract call with the specified gas limit. It also returns `false` when either
argument is invalid. For example, if expiry second is invalid because it is not after
current consensus time, or because it is too far in the future). The goal is to assure
contract authors that when `hasScheduleCapacity(expiry, limit)` returns `true`, a subsequent
valid call to `scheduleCall(to, expiry, limit, ...)` will _also_ succeed.

The gas cost for scheduling variants will follow Hedera's standard system contract gas
schedule, which is set based on the relative resource usage of the equivalent HAPI
`ScheduleCreate` transaction. This approach remains consistent with existing Hedera
prices and ensures predictable fees between system contract and HAPI.

We suggest the following retry pattern to find an available second not before the first 
second a contract would want a scheduled call to execute. This pattern keeps the simplicity
and rapid convergence of exponential back‑off while adding a harmless, non‑manipulable
jitter so that many contracts using it to probe the same ideal second naturally scatter
across nearby seconds instead of stampeding into the same one.

```solidity
function findAvailableSecond(
    uint256 expiry,
    uint256 gasLimit,
    uint maxProbes
) returns (uint256 second) {
    if (HSS.hasScheduleCapacity(expiry, gasLimit)) {
        return expiry;
    }
    // Use the PREVRANDAO seed to add jitter to probes
    bytes32 seed = block.prevrandao;
    for (uint i; i < maxProbes; ++i) {
        // 1, 2, 4, 8, ... seconds
        uint256 baseDelay = 1 << i;
        // Jitter, hash the seed with loop‑index
        bytes32 h = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(seed, i));
        // Clamp the lowest 16 bits to [0, min(65536, baseDelay))
        uint16 r = uint16(uint256(h));
        uint256 jitter = uint256(r) % baseDelay;
        uint256 candidate = expiry + baseDelay + jitter;
        if (HSS.hasScheduleCapacity(candidate, gasLimit)) {
            return candidate;
        }
    }
    revert("No unsaturated second after max probes");
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility
No existing features are modified as this only exposes HAPI functionality to smart
contracts.

## Security Implications

On the surface, one might worry this proposal would let a contract create an infinite
loop by scheduling a call to itself at the same second it is currently executing. However,
HSS requires the scheduled second to be strictly later than the current consensus second.
So it would be strictly more expensive to saturate a Hiero network's gas throttle by
scheduling contract calls than it would be to simply submit those calls through HAPI.

## How to Teach This

Smart contracts can now schedule calls to other contracts (or themselves!) from inside the EVM.

## Reference Implementation

In progress, see an initial hackathon implementation [here](https://github.com/tinker-michaelj/hedera-services/tree/autumn).

## Rejected Ideas

We considered a proposal to add "schedule not before" semantics to the HAPI `ScheduleCreate`
operation. But since it is relatively trivial to support a cheap `hasScheduleCapacity()`
probe, and it is possible contract authors might want to customize their retry strategies
in many ways, we instead settled on providing an example retry strategy and letting contract
developers roll their own. 

## Open Issues

- Scheduling a Contract Create transaction is out of the scope of this HIP. Providing a zero `to` address parameter 
 for the `scheduleCall()`, `scheduleCallWithPayer()` and `executeCallOnPayerSignature()` functions is considered invalid
 and will result in failure with `INVALID_CONTRACT_ID` response code.
 Additionally, the ability to schedule contract creation could be introduced with a future HIP or an extension to this one.
