## Abstract
With the addition of Block Nodes to the Hiero ledger, clients will need a
reliable mechanism to find functioning block nodes. This HIP proposes to add
a new type of address book entry, and transactions to enable block node
operators to add and manage their nodes in the network.

## Motivation
Block Nodes are a critical component of any Hiero ledger. The Block Nodes
manage and provide access to Block Stream and state snapshot data, as well
as content proof for both blocks and state. Block Nodes may also provide
additional value-add services integral to their core function, and may charge
fees for providing both core and value-add services to clients. A service
is of no value, however, if the service provider cannot be found. Offering a
mechanism to find a Block Node by querying network state ensures a reliable
and trustworthy source of data that is dynamically managed and updated by the
Block Node operators themselves.

## Rationale
Discoverability of services is critical to a broadly useful network and
effective development of network applications. The addition of basic service
discovery functionality supports the current addition of block nodes to the
network, and lays groundwork for adding additional discovery mechanisms in
future proposals. While the proximate motivation for this capability is to
enable discoverability of block nodes, it is also clear that block nodes are
not the only form of discoverable nodes that could, or should, be published
on the blockchain.

## Definitions
<dl>
<dt>Discoverable Node</dt>
<dd>A node that participates in a Hiero Ledger network, but is not a
consensus node, is a discoverable node, and may be discovered via the node
discovery process. Discoverable nodes do not require on-chain upgrade
coordination and are generally managed as fully independent individual
entities. Each type of discoverable node has its own mechanism for discovering
and using resources specific to that type of node. The address book only
provides the type of node and one or more service endpoints.</dd>
</dl>

## User stories
1. As a RPC Relay client, I wish to find an RPC relay using on-chain data.
1. As a Block Node, I need to connect to other block nodes found by inspecting
   block stream data.
1. As a Mirror Node, I want to present discoverable nodes to clients using
   on-chain data.
1. As a Hiero community member, I want to operate a discoverable node and
   publish the type and endpoints on-chain so that others can find my service.
1. As the operator of a private Hiero ledger, I want to manage the discoverable
   nodes relevant to my ledger using on-chain data.
1. As a discoverable node operator, I want to publish and manage my discoverable
   node on a Hiero ledger so that clients can reliably find and connect to my
   service.
1. As a Hiero network governing entity I want the option to reward trusted
   providers of critical network infrastructure services on-chain.

## Specification
This HIP proposes the introduction of additional NodeService APIs that enable a
discoverable node operator to create, delete, and update discoverable nodes.

Several messages refer to a "Node ID". This is a single entity number that
is assigned on node creation by the network, and is unique within a particular
shard and realm. Discoverable nodes are specific to a shard and realm, although
nothing technically prevents a single system from being registered as a node in
multiple shards or multiple realms. The consensus network may assign any value
to a new node, except that a given Node ID must never be reused within a given
shard or realm. The Node ID values for Discoverable Nodes must not match the
Node ID value for any consensus node in the same network.

```protobuf
service AddressBookService {

    [...]

    /**
     * A transaction to create a new discoverable node in the network
     * address book.
     * <p>
     * This transaction, once complete, SHALL add a new discoverable node to the
     * network state.<br/>
     * The new discoverable node SHALL be visible and discoverable upon
     * completion of this transaction.
     */
    rpc createDiscoverableNode (proto.Transaction) returns (proto.TransactionResponse);

    /**
     * A transaction to remove a discoverable node from the network address
     * book.
     * <p>
     * This transaction, once complete, SHALL remove the identified discoverable
     * node from the network state.
     */
    rpc deleteDiscoverableNode (proto.Transaction) returns (proto.TransactionResponse);

    /**
     * A transaction to update an existing discoverable node in the network
     * address book.
     * <p>
     * This transaction, once complete, SHALL modify the identified discoverable
     * node state as requested.
     */
    rpc updateDiscoverableNode (proto.Transaction) returns (proto.TransactionResponse);
}
```

A new Hiero API element will be added, named DiscoverableServiceEndpoint.

```protobuf
/**
 * A discoverable network node endpoint.<br/>
 * Each discoverable network node in the global address book publishes one or
 * more endpoints which enable the nodes to communicate both with other
 * nodes and with clients to receive requests.
 *
 * This message supports a TCP port and IP address (V4 or V6),
 * or MAY include a FQDN _instead of_ an IP address.<br/>
 */
message DiscoverableServiceEndpoint {
    oneof address {
        /**
         * A 32-bit IPv4 address or 128-bit IPv6 address.<br/>
         * This is the address of the endpoint, encoded in pure "big-endian"
         * (i.e. left to right) order (e.g. `127.0.0.1` has hex bytes in the
         * order `7F`, `00`, `00`, `01` and `::1` is `00`, `00`, `00`, `00`,
         * `00`, `00`, `00`, `00`, `00`, `00`, `00`, `00`, `00`, `00`,
         * `00`, `01`).
         */
        bytes ip_address = 1;

        /**
         * A node domain name.
         * <p>
         * This MUST be the fully qualified domain name of the node.<br/>
         * This value MUST NOT exceed 250 ASCII characters.<br/>
         * This value MUST meet all other DNS name requirements.
         */
        string domain_name = 2;
    }

    /**
     * A network port to use.
     * <p>
     * This value MUST be between 0 and 65535, inclusive.<br/>
     * This value is REQUIRED.
     */
    uint32 port = 3;
}
```

A new Hiero API will be added called DiscoverableNodeCreate, which falls under
the Node Service category. This function is used by the node operator to create
a new node.

The following are some changes to the existing API.

Added three HieroFunctionalities:

```protobuf
enum HieroFunctionality {

    [...]

    /**
    * Create a discoverable node
    */
    DiscoverableNodeCreate = 101;

    /**
     * Update a discoverable node
     */
    DiscoverableNodeUpdate = 102;

    /**
     * Delete a discoverable node
     */
    DiscoverableNodeDelete = 103;
}
```

Adjusted `node_id` in `TransactionReceipt`:

```protobuf
message TransactionReceipt {

    [...]

    /**
     * The identifier of a newly created Node or DiscoverableNode.
     * <p>
     * This value SHALL be set following a `createNode` transaction.<br/>
     * This value SHALL be set following a `createDiscoverableNode`
     * transaction.<br/>
     * This value SHALL NOT be set following any other transaction.<br/>
     * This value SHALL be unique within a given network.<br/>
     * This value SHALL NOT match any consensus node ID in the same network.
    */
    uint64 node_id = 15;

}
```

### Mirror node update
The mirror node will process the new Discoverable Node transactions and
discoverable_service_endpoint information, then return that information through
extensions to its existing APIs or new APIs, as needed.
One _possible_ extension would be to add a `/api/v1/network/discoverableNodes`
resource which accepts a `nodeType` query parameter and returns a list of nodes
with that type, or a list of all discoverable nodes if the parameter is not
supplied.

### SDK Considerations
Each SDK will need to implement the following _new_ transactions.
- `createDiscoverableNode`
- `updateDiscoverableNode`
- `deleteDiscoverableNode`
There is no change to existing transactions. The create transaction sets the
same `node_id` field in the transaction receipt used by the existing
non-discoverable nodeCreate transaction.

## Backwards Compatibility
All changes for this HIP are net-new functionality. There is no predicted
impact or change for existing functionality.

## Security Implications
The signatory for all discoverable node transactions (create, update, delete)
is the assigned `admin_key` value for that node. This maintains management of
each discoverable node firmly with the creator/operator. Discoverable nodes do
not participate in regular consensus network rewards, so no account
identifier is required for a discoverable node. If a particular Hiero network
choses to use the "discoverable node rewards" feature, then those nodes that
are enabled for rewards MUST provide an account ID in order to receive those
rewards. It is RECOMMENDED that the `admin_key` be composed of one or more
unique public keys that are not associated with any network account.

The network throttles will need to be updated to place appropriate limits on
the number of discoverable node transactions. Such transactions should not be
frequent, and relevant throttles should have corresponding limits.

We do not expect to place any restriction on who can create a discoverable node,
long term, and the only limitation to who can update or delete a discoverable
node will eventually be that the transaction must be signed by the `admin_key`
for that node. In the short term, however, some Hiero networks may choose,
as a governance policy, to limit discoverable node creation until this feature
includes suport for reputation or other functionality not included in the
current proposal.

## How to Teach This
TBD

## Reference Implementation

## Rejected Ideas
1. Use of the existing consensus node address book and transactions was
   considered.
   * This was rejected for three reasons.
      1. The existing Node transactions and state objects include a substantial
         amount of data that has no relevancy to discoverable nodes
      2. The consensus nodes do not, and should not, include the additional
         information specific to discoverable nodes
      3. The modification of discoverable nodes and consensus nodes have
         vastly different risk profiles, and mandate very different signatory
         requirements.
1. For the "node rewards" optional feature, we considered using the presence or
   absence of a rewards account ID alone rather than a combination of a flag
   and the account ID.
   * We chose to include the flag because the account ID should be updatable by
     the node operator independently, but whether a particular node is enabled
     for rewards MUST require a signature by the network governance account(s).

## Open Issues
1. We intended to store a uint64 "reputation" value for each discoverable node,
   but have not determined an appropriate and workable mechanism for allowing
   network entities to "vote" on that reputation.
   * One concept discussed is to use something similar to a
     "proof of space-time" and a "proof of streaming" for block nodes
     (as one example) as an automated "reputation" modifier. How this would
     be integrated with community sentiment remains an open question.
   * This concept should be the subject of a future HIP.
